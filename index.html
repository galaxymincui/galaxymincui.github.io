										<h2 class="major">Removal of Geostationary Debris in light of
										Commercialized Space Activities (REGDECSA)</h2>
										<p>Nowadays, space debris orbiting the Earth represent 95% of total number
										of objects in space. The remaining 5% objects are active satellites. The
										amount of space junk will increase while the world's spaceflight activities
										continue. The rising population of space debris increases the potential danger
										to all space vehicles and the risk of debris reentries.
										Several variable Active Debris Removal (ADR) concepts have been studied such as capture methods (i.e. nets) or remote methods (i.e. lasers) or
										electromagnetic methods (i.e. electromagnetic tethers). However, those solutions are efficient with small size objects or require complex technologies
										which may be risky and costly. </p>
										<p>
										REmoval of Geostationary DEbris in light of commercialized Space Activities (REGDESA) is an ADR concept for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit
										(GEO) space debris with a contact-less method, Ion-Beam Shepherd (IBS).
										As this method consists of pushing space debris using an ion beam, it is a
										solution for the size of debris or a complex mechanism.
										Our aim is to transfer large GEO space debris to the graveyard using the
										ion engines with 266 mN thrust level by carrying out the multiple de-orbiting
										and re-orbiting maneuvers to remove 10 debris objects during REGDESA
										operating time. </p>

										<p>Star formation in the early Universe remains unobserved in the
										far-infrared. This paper presents the scientific justification for, and
										technical feasibility of, a new space telescope: the Polycyclic Aromatic
										Hydrocarbon Space Telescope (PAHST). PAHST will use PAH emission lines
										redshifted to 30--200 microns to provide an unprecedented view of star
										formation at z = 4.5--6.0. The mission will also investigate the
										formation of high-density ridges from filaments in the interstellar
										medium, the nature of cool brown dwarfs and their surrounding dusty
										disks. PAHST can achieve its science objectives at Lagrange point L2 with
										an 8 m diameter primary mirror, cooled to 4 K and coupled to a high
										sensitivity photometer and spectrometer. The mission is compatible with
										the Ariane 6 launch vehicle and can be an ESA L-class mission. PAHST is
										the result of the ESA/FFG Alpbach Summer School 2017 on the topic of dust
										in the Universe and the follow-up Post-Alpbach Event.</p>

										<h2 class="major">the EuRopean Extinction BUmp Survey (EREBUS)</h2>
										<p>Dust in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) is intimately linked to the life cycle of stars. Despite being of such fundamental 
										importance to galaxy evolution, the dynamic behaviour and composition of the ISM are not yet fully understood. 
										Observations of reddened Milky Way OB stars have revealed a strong UV extinction feature around 2175 Ã… and 
										a precipitous extinction rise to the far UV along the lines of sight. Whilst the carrier(s) for this are at present still being debated, 
										multiple laboratory studies suggest carbonate grains to be the key constituent. EREBUS is a mission concept being developed to study 
										the composition of the ISM in both the Milky Way and Local Group Galaxies, primarily by mapping the spatial distribution of 
										the UV extinction features. As these features are sensitive to the dust composition along the line of sight, 
										EREBUS will provide a wealth of information about the spatial distribution and dynamic behaviour of the carrier(s). 
										The mission proposes to deploy a satellite observatory equipped with a coarse UV spectrograph to map the extinction curve variability 
										in the Milky Way in 3 dimensions and in the Local Group in 2 dimensions. In this paper, we discuss the scientific goals for the project, 
										discuss a proposed observation strategy using an iterative process to develop a hierarchical map, and finally outline the instrument 
										requirements and preliminary spacecraft architecture.</p>
